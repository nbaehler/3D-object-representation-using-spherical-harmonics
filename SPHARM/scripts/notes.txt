Changes:
-   In do_pca -> replace princomp by pca at 21
-   RUN.m
-   AUTOMLCombineAndResize: 119, rescaleSize = 1;
-   AUTOMLCombineAndResize: 98 -> 100, newName = [newName '_OL']; outside the ifs
-   Avoid GUI interaction -> make AUTO... copies of the files and remove the
    UI parts
-   AUTOMLMakeTemplate: 76, - load smo file in order to speed up the process
                            - use 16 places after the comma not 9 at the end

-   remove centroid part  

Notes:
-   'Least square for 10002 equations and 2601 unknowns' -> seems to be the upper
    limit for unknowns, the ones who need more fail.
    -> 50 is the biggest value that was ok on my Laptop (has exactly 2601 lsunknowns).
-   For now I have to work on windows -> spa.exe (and msvcrtd.dll)
